# Haskell Kickstart

## Installation
I've included a short script that will install Haskell and the relevant packages assuming you have OSX and Homebrew.

```
bin/osx-setup
```

Should you choose to install everything manually you will need The Haskell Platform and The cabal-dev package.

## Running the tests
To run the tests use the `bin/run-tests` script.
